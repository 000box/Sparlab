See Troubleshooting at the bottom of this guide if you are having any issues.


'Settings:


Below are descriptions for each settings:

'Action Files: These APPDATA files are where your actions are imported from.
'fps: Manipulates the time length used by the 'j_f' function
'default direction: Can be 'R' or 'L'.
'play hotkey: Toggles b/w Play and Pause
'flip x axis hotkey: When flipped, any analog value with a non-zero x value is flipped.
'virtual joy port: The 'port' where your virtual joystick plugs into. Can be 1,2,3 or 4.
'physical joy type: Can be 'arcade stick', 'xbox', 'keyboard', or 'None'.
'Delay Variables: These are for inserting into your script/action strings to simulate delay.
'virtual joy text color: The color of this joy\'s outfeed text.
'physical joy text color: The color of this joy\'s outfeed text.
'virtual joy type: This setting must be equal to 'xbox' for now.

'analog configs: 'x fix' & 'y fix' are the configs used by your vjoy. 'x min','x max','y min', & 'y max' are used by your pjoy in order to categorize its analog states.
'button configs: Mapping of buttons to ('press function', 'release function'). Arcade Stick Only: Must have valid vendor ID. All buttons have a valid page ID, each button must have a valid usage ID. \
Hat switch must have one valid usage id. You can find this information by viewing your Device Report (In tools) ,

Action Editor:

-filename: name of the text file inside your Appdata folder
-include: can be True or False. Setting this to True gives you the ability to use the action config's defined notations.
-action config: This is where the app pulls from when you use hotkeys or play notation scripts. Each tab in the editor represents a file you have listed in your 'Action Files' in Settings.

Each action has its own Name (e.g. 'double dash'), Notation (e.g. 'dd'), Hotkey (e.g. 'd+-'), and string (e.g. ['la_r', 'delay(0.015)', 'la_n', 'delay(0.015)', 'la_r', 'delay(0.015)', 'la_n'])

Examples of correctly formatted actions:

'right punch:			{'Notation': '2', 'Hotkey': 'None', 'String': ['y_d', 'delay(0.020)', 'y_u']},
'start:			{'Notation': 'None', 'Hotkey': '`', 'String': ['start_d', 'delay(0.020)', 'start_u']}

Hotkeys:

These are useful for testing your newly created Actions or if you need to navigate around a menu with your VJoy.

Syntax Rules:
-Hotkeys must be surrounded by quotations. (e.g 'h+k', "space", 'u')
-Each key for your hotkey must be separated by a '+' if you want to apply multiple keys. (e.g. 'space+u', 'shift+/+.')
-If you want to use '\' as a hotkey, it has to be listed like this: '\\'
-If you want to use a single quotation, it has to be listed like this: "'" (cannot be ''')


Notation:

A notation is a variable representing an Action you want to be played in your script, which means that the Action being represented MUST have a valid String attached with it.

Syntax Rules: In Action Editor, Notations must be surrounded by quotations (e.g 'd/f', "u/r", '1')


Creating a Script:

Follow these guidelines for successful conversion of notations:
-  Everything must be separated with a SPACE
	Correct: [ d d/r r 3 ]
	Incorrect: [dd/rr3]
- The string of actions you want to execute when you press ‘Play’ must be contained in brackets on the first line of your textbox.
-Correct: [ 1+2 ]
-Incorrect: 1+2
- All notations must be included in actions inside your Action Editor.


Delay Variables:

These are for inserting into your script or strings in your Action Editor to simulate delay time in seconds.

-Example:

	-dv1 = 0.015
	-A notation script of [ 1 dv1 2 ] would be equal to a string of [ *1's String* *delay(0.015)* *2's String* ]
	-A string that looks like ['a_d','delay(dv1)','a_u'] would be equal to a string of ['a_d','delay(0.015)','a_u']

How to use Auto Adjustment

This feature changes a delay variable FOR YOU while your script is playing.

Var.: Variable to adjust during Script Play
Val.: amount of adjustment
Freq.: adjust every N script play throughs


In-app commands:

Delay Variables: these can be inserted into your script to simulate delay (in seconds).
Enable HKs: turns on the hotkeys you have defined in your Action Editor.
Flip X Axis: switches the directions of all functions that have an X Direction (e.g. 'dpr_d' --> 'dpl_d', 'la_dl' --> 'la_dr').
Turn VJoy On: plugs in your VJoy Device.
Refresh: re-commits your settings. This is useful if you are changing devices.
Save Log: saves all the


Troubleshooting:

Error: '_ is not a valid device type. Change your pjoy type in Settings':
-Your PJoy has to be one of the following: 'xbox', 'arcade stick', 'keyboard', or 'None'. Go into your Settings, change it to one of those, press 'commit'.

Error: "Key '___' is not mapped to any known key.", ValueError(...':

-This error will occur if you are using an invalid key on your keyboard when your keyboard is the assigned physical joy type. The key that is giving you the error is likely not on your keyboard. Go
back into Settings, scroll down to 'button configs/', scroll to 'keyboard' underneath it, change the key to a valid key, press Commit. You may have to reset the app to get the key to work.

Error/Warning: 'invalid syntax(<string>, x...':

-Error/Warning(s) will occur if you leave out a quotation, curly bracket, bracket, colon, or comma. Go to line 'x' and look for the missing item, insert the missing character, then re-commit.
-If quote: make sure it matches to the one on the other side of the phrase before you re-commit.

-Error: 'A device with vendor id "__" could not be found'

-This happens when you have 'arcade stick' as your 'physical joy type' and you are not using a vendor id that is listed in your Device Report. Refer to the Arcade Stick instructions in 'Physical Joystick Configuration' above.

Error: 'No value was found for _'

-This occurs when you have 'arcade stick' set as your PJoy and you forgot to map a button for your device. Refer to the Arcade Stick instructions in 'Physical Joystick Configuration' above.

Error: 'No input report found for page ID "_" (vendor= "_",....'

-This occurs if you have an invalid page ID listed inside your PJoy configurations when using an Arcade Stick. Refer to the Arcade Stick instructions in 'Physical Joystick Configuration' above.


VJoy is not working when turned on: this can occur when there is an update to your OS, which alters the state of the virtual driver. Try uninstalling the driver and re-installing it. If that
doesn't work, you may have to reset your PC and try it.

My XBOX controller input is not being detected, and I have 'xbox' set as the 'physical joystick type': Restart the app.

Blank Action Editor/Settings File: you might have a typo in one of the text files and need to fix it inside your APPDATA Files.
	In your file explorer, go to YOURNAME/AppData/Roaming/Sparlab/*version#*, open up the file that is blank in the app, correct the typo, save the file, and restart the app.

App not loading: you may need to clear your app's memory. To do that, go to YOURNAME/AppData/Roaming/Sparlab, copy (backup) the Sparlab folder to a non-AppData location such as your desktop,
delete the Sparlab folder inside of YOURNAME/AppData/Roaming/, and relaunch the app. If that doesn't work, try restarting your computer. If that doesn't solve the problem, go to www.umensch.com/downloads and install the newest version.
If it is still not loading, post the issue to the Sparlab community (https://www.reddit.com/r/Sparlab/) or the project repository (https://github.com/johnward-umensch/Sparlab), you can also try downloading the newest release
from the releases tab in the github repository.

Getting same error after making correction: this bug will hopefully be fixed in the next version. Until then, restarting the app should solve your problem.
