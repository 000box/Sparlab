Developers

Long-term vision:

We want Sparlab to be a tool that every fighting gamer uses. They will use this tool instead of built-in game features and other third party injection tools because:

1) it will scale equally across all fighting games and devices. This will allow gamers to cross-train more easily than in the past.
build a stable, scalable and useful training platform for fighting gamers. 
2) it will be provide detailed performance reports with machine learning algorithms, allowing gamers to understand themselves and their opponents at much deeper levels. 
3) it will be customizable and accessible by the end user upon the creation of an API, giving users the ability to train machine learning models, simulate/replay scenarios with reinforcement/immitation learning, etc.
4) it will be continuously supported and improved by the community. 

For Sparlab to realize this vision, we can't do this on our own. We need your help. What ideas do you have that are missing from the project? Where problems do you see and how can you help solve it? What improvements can be made to the front-end design and backend architecture? Whether you are new to programming or have years of experience, we would love to see contributions from you, ESPECIALLY if you are self-motivated and passionate in applying A.I to help people evolve to their potential. If you want to work on your own version of Sparlab, use it inside your project, or distribute your own copies, you have full permission to do so as stated in the attached General Public License.
